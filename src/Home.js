        <h2>Empowering the tech community to embrace our humanity</h2>
        <p> The social hierarchy that has been built up through intense
            peer-to-peer competition starting in universities is perpetuated in the workplace. 
            This has created a culture of insecurity where a few feel elite and overconfident while 
            others feel nervousness, anxiety, and a lack of confidence. This is leading us down a 
            path of inefficiency as we are afraid of sharing information with others, being judged 
            by them, and threatening our place in the social order. This needs to stop.
        </p>
        <p> The Humans in Tech Project aims to create a tech community built upon our shared humanity. 
            This is a world where individuals and teams will engage in inclusive collaboration by 
            being empathetic, vulnerable, and generous. We believe that the resulting safe culture will 
            allow individuals to experience a sense of purpose, allow teams to capitalize on their memberâ€™s 
            knowledge/creativity, and allow the community as a whole to create technology aligned with the 
            values of humanity.
