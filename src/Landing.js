Consequently, after earning a BS in Physics (Cal Poly, SLO) and a MS in Electrical & Computer Engineering (UCSB), he earned his PhD in Psychology (UCSB). Years of international consulting for data storage device R&D labs followed. Clients would engage Tim for his technical expertise, but they would retain him because the R&D teams became more effective. He saw firsthand that empathy is a critically important skill for all tech professionals. Tim co-founded Humans in Tech to promote empathy within the tech community.'
