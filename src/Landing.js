            <p> The Humans in Tech Project aims to create a tech community built upon our shared humanity. 
                This is a world where individuals and teams will engage in inclusive collaboration by 
                being empathetic, vulnerable, and generous. We believe that the resulting safe culture will 
                allow individuals to experience a sense of purpose, allow teams to capitalize on their memberâ€™s 
                knowledge/creativity, and allow the community as a whole to create technology aligned with the 
                values of humanity.
