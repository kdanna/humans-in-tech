## Humans in Tech

The Humans in Tech Project aims to create a tech community built upon our shared humanity. This is a world where individuals and teams will engage in inclusive collaboration by being empathetic, vulnerable, and generous. We believe that the resulting safe culture will allow individuals to experience a sense of purpose, allow teams to capitalize on their memberâ€™s knowledge/creativity, and allow the community as a whole to create technology aligned with the values of humanity.
